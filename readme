# Node.js Express CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Docker

This repository demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js Express application, leveraging GitHub Actions and Docker for automated building, testing, containerization, and deployment to a remote server.

## Features

- **Automated Build and Test**: Automatically builds and tests the application upon each push to the `master` branch.
- **Docker Image Creation**: Packages the application into a Docker container and pushes it to Docker Hub.
- **Remote Deployment**: Uses `appleboy/ssh-action` for secure SSH-based deployment, stopping existing containers and running the updated image.
- **Secrets Management**: Securely handles credentials like SSH keys and Docker Hub credentials with GitHub Secrets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. **Docker**: Install Docker to create and run containers.
3. **GitHub Secrets Setup**:
   - Configure repository secrets for sensitive data, such as:
     - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` for Docker Hub authentication.
     - `HOST`, `HOST_IP`, `USERNAME`, `KEY`, and `PORT` for SSH connection details.

### Basic Express App Setup

1. **Initialize a Node.js Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir cicd-express-app
   cd cicd-express-app
   npm init -y
